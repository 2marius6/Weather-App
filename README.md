# What has been done by now:
- implemented basic functionality and interaction with the API (sunrise/sunset hour, , live clock, temperature (both in C and F))
- implemented variable icons depending on the weather
- implemented location identification

# What is left to do:
needed:
- showing weather for next 5 days
- showing real feel temperature, atmospheric pressure, location altitude, time zone, humidity
- showing wind data (speed, direction)
- daily min/max temperature

# Optional:
- variable wallpaper and font color depending on location, time and weather (static one if not possible)
- live analogic clock instead of digital
